    "DNSmasq provides a local DNS server, allowing you to resolve private DNS entires, including wildcards, to localhost for a development cluster.   This allows us to closely mimic a production environment for local testing.  For valid URLs owned by our organization, we can also setup valid TLS certificates and perform full L7 routing to our cluster, allowing us to expose many applications running in a local cluster for development and testing.\n",
