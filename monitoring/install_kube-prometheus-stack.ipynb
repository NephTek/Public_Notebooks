    "# kube-prometheus-stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Kube-prometheus-stack is a helm chart created and supported by the open-source community to assist in deploying Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanger, and the Prometheus Operator to Kubernetes.  In addition to these core components, the kube-prometheus-stack also creates a number of out-of-the-box service monitors, dashboards, and alerts, providing an excellent starting point for monitoring and observability for k8s clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grafana provides dashboarding capabilities, and is the primary interface we use to observe central logs, metrics, and APM data.  Prometheus is a time-series database for collecting and querying metrics and to generate alerts.  Alertmanager takes the alerts generated by Prometheus and distributes them by email, SMS, or instant messaging.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Prometheus collects metrics from endpoints known as Prometheus Exporters.  These exporters publish metrics in a simple `key{metadata}=value` format, with one data point per line, in human-readable endpoints.  The Prometheus Operator defines a number of custom resources that control behavior of the metrics collection process--ServiceMonitors, PodMonitors, and Probes.  Additionally, alerting rules make use of another custom resource, PrometheusRules.  Collectively, these custom resources allow applications to declaratively define metrics collection, dashboards, and rules for monitoring and alerting.\n",
